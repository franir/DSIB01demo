# DSIB01demo
Demo repository for the purposes of DSIB01 course in autumn 2021.

Practical 1 
Getting virtual machine and installing GitHub

Practical 2
Learn the basic shell comands and how to direct and upload files in the folders
I picked a gene and I downloded the following gene

Practical 3
Learn how to assess quality control by downloading and correcting sequences using fastaq
BEFORE ADAPTOR TRIMMINGS:ENCFF019WXR Per base sequence content (!) ; Per sequence GC content; Sequence duplication level (X); Overrepresented sequences (!)
ENCFF166EBF Per base sequence content (!); Per sequence GC content (!); Sequence duplication levels (!); Overrepresented sequences (!)
AFTER ADAPTORS TRIMMING: ENCFF019WXR reads1 Per base sequence content (!); Per sequence GC content(!); Sequence Lenght Distribution(!); Sequence Duplication Levels (X); Overrepresented sequences(!)
ENCFF166EBF reads2 Per base sequence content (X); Per sequence GC content (!); Sequence Lenght Distribution (!); Sequence Duplications Levels(X); Overrepresented sequences (!)

Practical 4
Work in progress

Practical 5
Files from lesson 5 presentation's were run on the virtual machine (steps 1 to 6)representing how to download bed file peaks and how to sort them. The file chr1.fa (received by email fro the professor) was used to follow the steps from 9 forward for motif detection. Unfortunately, an error occured during step 9 (uploading of the files on MEME-Chip: an error in the fasta sequence was detected by the system. A screenshot of the error was taken. If needed I can send it by email)
